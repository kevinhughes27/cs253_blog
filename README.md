==========

This is the final version of the blog I programmed for Udacity's CS 253 course with Steve Huffman. The course is online and free at https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253 and comes highly recommended from me!

I wrote all of python code and HTML templates but most of the css was provided by the course. This code is slightly different than my first attempt at each homework because I often incorporated elements from Steve's solution after finishing the homework.
